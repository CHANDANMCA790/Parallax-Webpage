            Android Studio is the official[8] integrated development environment
            (IDE) for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains'
            IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android
            development.[9] It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux
            based operating systems.[10] It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android
            Development Tools (E-ADT) as the primary IDE for native Android
            application development. Android Studio was announced on May 16, 2013,
            at the Google I/O conference. It was in early access preview stage
            starting from version 0.1 in May 2013, then entered beta stage starting
            from version 0.8 which was released in June 2014.[11] The first stable
            build was released in December 2014, starting from version 1.0.[12] At
            the end of 2015, Google dropped support for Eclipse ADT, making Android
            Studio the only officially supported IDE for Android development.[13] On
            May 7, 2019, Kotlin replaced Java as Google's preferred language for
            Android app development.[14] Java is still supported, as is C++.[15]

        <p>
            The following features are provided in the current stable
            version:[16][17] Gradle-based build support Android-specific refactoring
            and quick fixes Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version
            compatibility and other problems ProGuard integration and app-signing
            capabilities Template-based wizards to create common Android designs and
            components A rich layout editor that allows users to drag-and-drop UI
            components, option to preview layouts on multiple screen
            configurations[18] Support for building Android Wear apps Built-in
            support for Google Cloud Platform, enabling integration with Firebase
            Cloud Messaging (Earlier 'Google Cloud Messaging') and Google App
            Engine[19] Android Virtual Device (Emulator) to run and debug apps in
            the Android studio. Android Studio supports all the same programming
            languages of IntelliJ (and CLion) e.g. Java, C++, and more with
            extensions, such as Go;[20] and Android Studio 3.0 or later supports
            Kotlin[21] and "all Java 7 language features and a subset of Java 8
            language features that vary by platform version."[22] External projects
            backport some Java 9 features.[23] While IntelliJ states that Android
            Studio supports all released Java versions, and Java 12, it's not clear
            to what level Android Studio supports Java versions up to Java 12 (the
            documentation mentions partial Java 8 support). At least some new
            language features up to Java 12 are usable in Android.[24] Once an app
            has been compiled with Android Studio, it can be published on the Google
            Play Store. The application has to be in line with the Google Play Store
            developer content policy. <br /><br />

            These features includes requirements for IDE + Android SDK + Android
            Emulator.[35] Windows: x86_64 CPU architecture; 2nd generation Intel
            Core or newer, or AMD CPU with support for a Windows Hypervisor; macOS:
            ARM-based chips, or 2nd generation Intel Core or newer with support for
            Hypervisor.Framework; Linux: x86_64 CPU architecture; 2nd generation
            Intel Core or newer, or AMD processor with support for AMD
            Virtualization (AMD-V) and SSSE3; Windows: CPU with UG (unrestricted
            guest) support; Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (HAXM)
            6.2.1 or later (HAXM 7.2.0 or later recommended). The use of hardware
            acceleration has additional requirements on Windows and Linux: Intel
            processor on Windows or Linux: Intel processor with support for Intel
            VT-x, Intel EM64T (Intel 64), and Execute Disable (XD) Bit
            functionality; AMD processor on Linux: AMD processor with support for
            AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) and Supplemental Streaming SIMD Extensions 3
            (SSSE3); AMD processor on Windows: Android Studio 3.2 or higher and
            Windows 10 April 2018 release or higher for Windows Hypervisor Platform
            (WHPX) functionality. For an attached webcam to work with Android 8.1
            (API level 27) and higher system images, it must have the capability to
            capture 720p frames.[36] <br><br>
